Current Task

> Ok, now we are going to do the 300s Series "Input System". Let me explain. This 
  contains the input bar. [Image #1] The input bar is pure UI. It has a text field. 
  Below the text field there is a controls row. The controls row has a + which is for
   file attachment. Then there is the model picker ui, the persona picker ui, our new
   theme picker ui and then on the far right there is a green sync light - which does
   nothing. I keep it there because it looks pretty ü§£! Ok, the input bar is a 
  powerhouse. If I type / then a meny of slash commands appear. One such command is 
  the /journal command. It elevates the top border of the input bar up 42 lines, 
  basically covering the entire message scrollback area and giving me space for 
  journaling. If in journal mode the input bar is empty and i press esc, it comes 
  back to the regular size and position. The regular size and position of the input 
  bar is sacred. Only the top border can move -the remaining 3 sides can never move. 
  When I write in the input bar, it should naturally push the top border up as the 
  text takes up new lines. I want all this done in strict adherence to the essential 
  boss rules. Read the Essential Boss Rules once again. How will you divide all this 
  into bricks in the 300s series?

‚è∫ Based on the Essential Boss Rules and your description of the 300s Series Input
  System, here's how I would divide it into bricks:

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òê Design 300s Series Input System brick architecture

‚è∫ 300s Series Input System Architecture

  BRICK-301 InputBar

  - Pure UI container with sacred positioning rules
  - Text field + controls row layout
  - Sacred Rule: Only top border moves, other 3 sides are immutable
  - Auto-expanding text area that pushes top border up
  - Publishes: InputResizedEvent, InputFocusEvent

  BRICK-302 SlashCommands

  - Slash command detection and menu system
  - Listens to text input, detects / trigger
  - Shows command palette UI overlay
  - Publishes: SlashCommandSelectedEvent
  - Commands: /journal, future extensible commands

  BRICK-303 JournalMode

  - Elevation system for journal interface
  - Subscribes to: SlashCommandSelectedEvent (/journal)
  - Elevates InputBar top border +42 lines over message area
  - ESC key handling to return to normal mode
  - Publishes: JournalModeToggledEvent

  BRICK-304 ControlsRow

  - Container for input controls (+ button, pickers, sync light)
  - File attachment button (+)
  - Integration points for existing pickers (model, persona, theme)
  - Pretty green sync light (decorative)
  - Publishes: FileAttachmentRequestedEvent

  BRICK-305 TextProcessor

  - Text input handling and processing
  - Multi-line text management
  - Auto-resize calculation for InputBar height
  - Text validation and formatting
  - Publishes: TextChangedEvent, InputSubmittedEvent

  BRICK-306 FileAttachment

  - File handling system
  - Drag & drop support
  - File type validation
  - Upload progress indication
  - Publishes: FileAttachedEvent, FileDroppedEvent

  Essential Boss Rules Compliance:

  Rule 1 (Webby): Native file APIs, CSS custom properties for layout, Svelte 5 runes
  Rule 2 (Four Buses): All inter-brick communication via EventBus, no direct
  dependencies
  Rule 5 (Easy Removal): Each brick deletable independently with graceful degradation
  Rule 10 (Demo-Driven): Each brick gets isolated demo showing all functionality

  Key Architectural Decisions:

  1. Sacred Positioning: InputBar owns the positioning rules, other bricks just
  request changes
  2. Event-Driven Layout: Height changes flow through EventBus, not direct DOM
  manipulation
  3. Mode System: JournalMode is separate brick that extends InputBar, not embedded
  logic
  4. Extensible Commands: SlashCommands designed for future expansion beyond /journal

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òí Design 300s Series Input System brick architecture

‚è∫ This architecture maintains strict separation while enabling the complex
  interactions you described. Each brick can be removed independently - remove
  JournalMode and you lose elevation, remove SlashCommands and you lose command
  palette, but the core InputBar continues working.

  What do you think of this brick division? Should we start with BRICK-301 InputBar
  as the foundation?

> I like it very much. Look, none of this is new. Much of it is already available out
   of the box in Svelte, correct?

‚è∫ Absolutely! You're spot on. Most of this is native Svelte functionality that we
  just need to orchestrate properly following the Essential Boss Rules:

  What's Already Built-In:

  Text Area Auto-Resize

  <!-- Svelte handles this automatically -->
  <textarea bind:value={text} style="resize: none; overflow: hidden;" 
            on:input={autoResize}></textarea>

  Slash Command Detection

  <!-- Just reactive statements -->
  $: showCommands = text.startsWith('/');
  $: filteredCommands = commands.filter(cmd => cmd.includes(text.slice(1)));

  Keyboard Handling

  <!-- Native DOM events -->
  <textarea on:keydown={handleKeydown}></textarea>

  function handleKeydown(e) {
    if (e.key === 'Escape' && journalMode) exitJournalMode();
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) submitText();
  }

  CSS Layout Animations

  /* Native CSS transitions for the "sacred positioning" */
  .input-bar {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    transform: translateY(var(--elevation, 0));
  }

  File Drag & Drop

  <!-- Native HTML5 APIs -->
  <div on:dragover|preventDefault on:drop={handleDrop}>

  The Real Work Is:

  1. Event Bus Integration - Making these native features communicate through buses
  2. State Management - Coordinating modes (normal vs journal) via StateBus
  3. Component Boundaries - Splitting into proper bricks following Rule 5
  4. Demo Gallery - Proving each piece works in isolation

  You're absolutely right - we're not rebuilding the web platform, we're
  orchestrating existing capabilities in a clean, decoupled architecture!

  This is exactly Rule 1 (Webby) in action: "Embrace web platform standards" rather
  than fighting them.

  Should we start with BRICK-301 InputBar and leverage these native capabilities?
